### Project Overview
The Surveilr Integration Testing project involves comprehensive testing to ensure the system functions as expected when ingesting, processing, and reporting data. The project focuses on testing data format compatibility, system performance under load, and accuracy of reports.

### Objectives
1. Validate multi-format data ingestion (JSON, CSV, XML).
2. Ensure data integrity during processing.
3. Assess performance under load and concurrent requests.
4. Automate the reporting and validation processes for compliance.

### Scope
- **In Scope**: Data ingestion, processing validation, and reporting functionalities.
- **Out of Scope**: Security testing.

### Communication Plan
- **Slack Channel**: `#surveilr-testing`
- **Weekly Update Meetings**: Every Thursday at 4:00 PM UTC
- **Email Contact**: admin@opsfolio.com

### Risks
- Potential delays in access to necessary test environments.
- Resource constraints for concurrent load testing.
- Errors in compliance metric calculations.
