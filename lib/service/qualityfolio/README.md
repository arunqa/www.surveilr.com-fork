# Qualityfolio Service Specification

The Qualityfolio Service Specification provides a comprehensive test management system designed within the **surveilr** platform. This open-source, compliance-oriented system leverages structured Markdown files, SQL querying, and a web-based UI, making it a robust alternative for quality and compliance-focused test management.

## Overview

### Purpose
The Qualityfolio Service aims to:
- Offer a secure, compliant, and customizable test management solution.
- Store test data in Markdown for traceable and easily integrable documentation.
- Use SQL for advanced querying, analytics, and reporting in a web UI.

### Key Components
- **Markdown-Based Test Storage**: Stores test narratives in Markdown for direct access and version control.
- **Foreign Integration Identifier (FII) System**: Unique codes enabling comprehensive traceability.
- **surveilr Ingestion Pipeline**: Automates Markdown and other test data ingestion into surveilr.
- **RSDD-Based SQLite Query Interface**: Facilitates real-time analytics for test management and tracking.
- **Web UI for Test Management**: Provides a user-friendly test management functionalities within surveilr.

## Structure

### Directory Structure
The test-related data is stored within `/qualityfolio-service-content`, organized the structure:

```
/qualityfolio-service-content
   ├── test-plans
   │   └── {test-plan-FII-code}.md
   ├── test-suites
   │   └── {test-suite-FII-code}.md
   ├── test-cases
   │   └── {test-case-FII-code}.md
   ├── test-runs
   │   └── {test-run-FII-code}.md
   └── test-results
       └── {test-result-FII-code}.md
```

### Example Format
---

## 1. **Test Suites**

A test suite groups related test cases. Here’s how a sample test suite might look in Markdown.

**File: `{test-suite-FII-code}.md`**

```markdown
---
suite_id: TS-001
title: User Login Suite
description: "This suite contains tests for verifying the user login functionality."
created_by: "QA Engineer"
created_date: "2023-11-13"
tags:
  - login
  - authentication
---

# User Login Test Suite

This suite tests the core functionality of the user login feature, including error handling and valid login scenarios.

## Test Cases

- [TC-001: Login with Valid Credentials](./test_cases/TC-001_login_valid.md)
- [TC-002: Login with Invalid Password](./test_cases/TC-002_login_invalid.md)
- [TC-003: Login with Empty Fields](./test_cases/TC-003_login_empty_fields.md)
```

---

### 2. **Test Cases**

Each test case file details the specific steps, expected results, and any necessary prerequisites.

**File: `{test-case-FII-code}.md`**

```markdown
---
test_case_id: TC-001
title: Login with Valid Credentials
description: "Verify that a user can log in with valid username and password."
priority: High
status: Active
preconditions: 
  - "User is registered in the system."
created_by: "QA Engineer"
created_date: "2023-11-13"
suite_id: TS-001
tags:
  - login
  - functional
---

# Login with Valid Credentials

## Preconditions

- User is registered in the system.

## Test Steps

1. Navigate to the login page.
2. Enter a valid username and password.
3. Click on the "Login" button.

## Expected Result

```

---

### 3. **Test Plans**

A test plan may encompass multiple suites or configurations and is designed to document the test strategy.

**File: `{test-plan-FII-code}.md`**

```markdown
---
test_plan_id: TP-001
title: Test Plan for Release v1.0
description: "This plan outlines the testing strategy and cases for Release v1.0."
created_by: "QA Lead"
created_date: "2023-11-13"
status: In Progress
suites:
  - TS-001
  - TS-002
tags:
  - release_v1.0
  - full_regression
---

### 4. **Test Results**

Test results can be stored individually for each test case in Markdown, making it easy to record and version control every execution instance.

**File: `{test-result-FII-code}.md`**

```markdown
---
result_id: TR-001
test_case_id: TC-001
test_plan_id: TP-001
execution_date: "2023-11-13"
executed_by: "QA Engineer"
status: Passed
environment: "Chrome 95, Windows 10"
notes: "All steps executed as expected. No issues found."

### 5. **Test Run (Optional)**

If you want to group results for specific runs (e.g., a specific build or sprint), you can create a test run file to track a specific execution batch.

**File: `test_runs/{test-run-FII-code}.md`**

```markdown
---
test_run_id: TRUN-005
title: Test Run for Sprint 5

## Key Features and Workflow

### 1. **Ingestion of Markdown and Automation Artifacts**
   - Automates ingestion of files into the surveilr `uniform_resource` table.
   - Uses FII codes to link files across test plans, cases, and runs.

### 2. **SQL Query Interface**
   - Provides SQL schema for querying test metrics, test statuses, and historical data.
   - Supports advanced queries, including test coverage and defect tracking.

### 3. **surveilr Web UI**
   - The functionality, including dashboards, test case management, and reporting.

### 4. **Integration and Automation**
   - CI/CD integration triggers automated tests for continuous feedback.
   - API endpoints allow integration with automation tools like Playwright and Postman.

## Commands

### 1. Ingest Markdown Content
```bash
surveilr ingest fs -d /qualityfolio-service-content
```
Extracts and refines email content, making it accessible for reporting and analysis.

## SQL Queries

### Count Test Cases by Status
```sql
SELECT status, COUNT(*) FROM qsw_test_case GROUP BY status;
```

### Recent Failures in a Test Run
```sql
SELECT test_case_fii, result, run_date 
FROM qsw_test_result 
WHERE result = 'fail' 
AND test_run_fii = 'TR-001'
ORDER BY run_date DESC;
```

## Web UI Setup

### Start surveilr Web UI
```bash
deno run -A ./package.sql.ts | surveilr shell   # Console mode
surveilr shell ./package.sql.ts                 # Alternative start
```
- **Access:** `http://localhost:9000/` for the surveilr web interface.

## Testing and Automation

### Run Tests
Execute Deno tests to verify Qualityfolio functionality:
```bash
deno test -A
```

This command creates an `assurance` folder with all test-related data and logs.

## Additional Notes

### Integration with Opsfolio
Qualityfolio aligns with Opsfolio for compliance workflows, supporting high traceability and integrity through SQL-based querying and Markdown documentation. Both systems enable evidence-based management and audit readiness, essential for regulated environments.

This documentation outlines Qualityfolio's structure, components, and workflows, enabling teams to leverage it as a robust, open-source solution for software testing and quality assurance.
