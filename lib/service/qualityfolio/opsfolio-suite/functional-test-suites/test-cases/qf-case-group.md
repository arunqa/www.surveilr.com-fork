### Overview
This test case group is designed to ensure the smooth operation and security of workflows within the Opsfolio suite by validating the following aspects:
- **Admin User Access Control**: Ensuring that Admin users have the correct permissions and roles for performing workflows.
- **Workflow Execution**: Verifying that workflows can be executed under valid and invalid conditions.
- **Error Identification**: Detecting any errors or inconsistencies that may disrupt workflows.
- **Automated Test Case Integration**: Supporting continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD) processes by automating critical test cases.
