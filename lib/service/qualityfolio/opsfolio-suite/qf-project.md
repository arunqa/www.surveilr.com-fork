### Project Overview
The Opsfolio Workflow Testing Project involves comprehensive testing to ensure all workflows function correctly. This includes smoke testing the suite application using an Admin user to identify potential issues and validate user permissions.

### Objectives
1. Achieve 100% coverage of critical workflows.
2. Validate access controls for Admin users.
3. Automate smoke tests in CI/CD pipelines for efficiency.
4. Generate and review test reports for audit purposes.

### Scope
- **In Scope**: Smoke testing of workflows in the Opsfolio suite.
- **Out of Scope**: Testing of non-admin functionalities.

### Communication Plan
- **Discord Channel**: `#opsfolio-testing`
- **Weekly Update Meetings**: Every Monday at 5:00 PM IST
- **Email Contact**: admin@opsfolio.com

### Risks
- Potential delays in infrastructure readiness.
- Limited test data availability.
- Integration challenges with CI/CD processes.
