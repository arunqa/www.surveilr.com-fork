DFA,"Detrended Fluctuation Analysis in the
prediction of type 2 diabetes mellitus in
patients at risk: Model optimization and
comparison with other metrics",2012-01-01,2015-05-31,,"y Instituto
de Salud Carlos III through the project PI17/00856
(Coâ€“funded by the European Regional
Development Fund, A way to make Europe)",,"This study applies a modified Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA) to glucose time series for predicting type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Key aspects include the use of time windows from 15 minutes to 24 hours, which enhanced predictive accuracy, and the analysis of 24-hour segments to minimize circadian rhythm effects. Raw, non-preprocessed data showed greater sensitivity and predictive power compared to preprocessed series. The algorithm also proved robust in handling up to 2% missing data. Principal Component Analysis revealed four components: glucose variability, DFA alpha exponent, and two pre-diabetic behaviors (impaired fasting glucose and impaired glucose tolerance). The modified DFA outperformed standard metrics in predicting T2DM risk in high-risk populations.This study applies a modified Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA) to glucose time series for predicting type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).
