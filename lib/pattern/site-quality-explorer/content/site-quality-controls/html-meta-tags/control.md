HTML meta tags are snippets of text placed in the <head> section of an HTML
document to provide metadata about the web page. They help browsers, search
engines, and social media platforms understand the pages content and purpose.
These tags improve search engine optimization (SEO), enhance social media
sharing, and aid in accessibility.
