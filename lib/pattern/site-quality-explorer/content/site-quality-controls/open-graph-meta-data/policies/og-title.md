The OG title is crucial for social sharing, as it serves as the headline when
the content is shared on social platforms. It should be descriptive, concise,
and attention-grabbing to encourage user engagement. Optimal length is between
30-60 characters. Avoid generic titles and make it unique and specific to the
content. If the content changes, consider updating the title to reflect the most
current context.
