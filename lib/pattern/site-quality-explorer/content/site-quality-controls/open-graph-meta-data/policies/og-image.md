The OG image provides a visual representation for the shared content. It should
be a high-quality image relevant to the content, ideally with a minimum
resolution of 1200x630 pixels and a 1.91:1 aspect ratio. JPEG or PNG formats are
preferred, and the file size should be under 5MB for optimal loading. This image
will appear in the link preview, attracting user attention and enhancing
engagement.
