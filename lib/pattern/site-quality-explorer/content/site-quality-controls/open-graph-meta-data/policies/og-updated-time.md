The OG updated time signals the freshness of the content to users, often
displayed as "last updated" on social platforms. It should follow the ISO 8601
format (e.g., 2024-11-01T10:00:00Z), indicating the date and time the content
was last modified. This helps users understand if the information is current and
relevant, which can increase trust and engagement.
