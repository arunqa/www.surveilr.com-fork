The OG type defines the nature of the content (e.g., "website" for a homepage or
"article" for blog posts). Common types include "article" (for news articles,
blogs), "website" (for general pages), "product" (for e-commerce products), and
"video" (for media). Correct specification of type ensures optimal rendering on
social platforms and helps them categorize content correctly.
