Open Graph metadata is a set of HTML meta tags used to control how web page
content appears when shared on social media platforms. Developed by Facebook,
the Open Graph protocol enables web pages to become "rich" objects, providing
specific data points like title, description, and images, which enhance link
previews and improve engagement. Placed within the <head> section, Open Graph
tags provide consistency across platforms and ensure that shared links appear
professional and informative.
