## ðŸš€ Bug Fixes

### 1. **`surveilr` SQLite Extensions**
To temporarily mitigate the issue with `surveilr` intermittently working due to the dynamic loading of extensions, `surveilr` no longer supports dynamic loading by default. It is now supported only upon request by using the `--sqlite-dyn-extn` flag. This flag is a multiple option that specifies the path to an extension to be loaded into `surveilr`. To obtain the dynamic versions (`.dll`, `.so`, or `.dylib`), you can use [`sqlpkg`](https://sqlpkg.org/) to install the necessary extension.

For instance, to utilize the `text` functions:
- Install the extension with [`sqlpkg`](https://sqlpkg.org/?q=text): `sqlpkg install nalgeon/text`
- Then execute it:
  ```bash
  surveilr shell --cmd "select text_substring('hello world', 7, 5);" --sqlite-dyn-extn ./text.so
  ```
