    This pattern is designed to facilitate the secure exchange of clinical data using the phiMail service. It consists of four main modules, each serving a distinct purpose within the overall system. These modules work together to securely and efficiently send, receive, process, and analyze clinical messages.


    PhiMail is a secure messaging service that facilitates the exchange of protected health information (PHI) in compliance with healthcare regulations like HIPAA. It is designed to support healthcare providers, organizations, and other stakeholders in securely transmitting health-related data, ensuring both privacy and integrity.
